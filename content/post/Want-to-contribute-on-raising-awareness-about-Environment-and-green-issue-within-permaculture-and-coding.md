## I'd like to distribute this country's eco system.

Since the nature's disaster have been taken place, this country needs raising the awareness on Balancing with nature.
`We need make a balance and respect this nature`.
Many people got economically damaged or lost living because of the disasters.
Flood damages, landslides, abnormally increased moths, careless chemical cropping, broken eco system and the fine particles problems.
All the things are the sign that people are not well-minded about Nature.
I'd like to encourage people to understand about the nature.
Probably, I should have to work in the company or organization which are willing to educate people about `Permaculture`, or `Nature system`.That's one of reason why I want to develop my Coding skill.

## One day, I hope that I can take a part in the organization to contribute this society.

Firstly, I must care my society, as Confucius has taught me.
`수기치인(修己治人)` is the thing one of saint of century point out for people.
Firstly care yourself, develop yourself, then contribute the society near yourself to make the world get peaces and happy.
Expand your influences to the near.

## Besides, Permaculture and nurturing nature is only way to live in harmony.
City is the place to roll in competitive system.
However, The nature never ask human for any competitions. 
The small and big crops are just trying their best to growing up. No matter what kind of crops, they are looking for the best version of themselves. When they fruiting, then they just return the yields without any concerns.
Crops have been chosen that way to rare themselves.
Their fruits which have the seeds inside, attract animals who can carry the seeds by intake. It means the crops have been fruiting on purpose. So that procedures help animals get yierd from the vegetables.

### Vegetables are having the guild system as well. 
Some crops are growing up only middle size, then it harmonize with Taller, and smaller size crops in a place.
Then the enormously amazing things happen. They help each other to grow up.
