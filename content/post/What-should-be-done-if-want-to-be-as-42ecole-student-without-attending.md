wanted to know what can I learn if attend the school.

Even though I'm not that much prepared with French.

They mainly focus on teaching code with C. C is the mostly interesting language for me, by its usage in various machine.


## Interesting

## Need to learn as 42 students.

It's difficult to afford the fare to arrive and stay for the 42ecole curriculum. So rather I should have to find out another way to learn the coding as 42 students.

## Book will be the alternative light for me.

- [A Freebook which is telling about how to design a programming.](https://htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/part_preface.html)

Since, I cannot move out there, I need to find out how to be raising myself as 42 students.
They learn from trial and error, and burning discussion with others.
Then the learning just happened during the whole process.

But I must understand that the code lines are coming from my head which shows me how much am I intelligent. 
No matter how many days attend 42Ecole, the result would be just up to my capacity.

## So, The matter is, just raising my capability.

Then the best answer 'how to raise my capacity' is book. Great book will widen my thought about what I'm looking for.


## Conclusion

I need reading books. The books must be all about 'Better learning by myself'.

As, 42ecole is focusing on how to make students learn 'how to learn'.

Fortunately, since I've tried to practice how to read English articles, the books which spreaded upon web as PDF form, are enough to learn how to code and to learn by all myself.

Even I feel so confident about my future as the path of programmer. Book is the answer.
