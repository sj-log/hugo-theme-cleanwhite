## Finally I installed Debian in this Lenovo pascal Laptop.

***I felt a bit suffering from setting Bluetooth disconnection problem.***
It so often happened in Ubuntu which I used for this laptop.

Now, The Debian was a bit difficult to install.
*I spent whole day to set it up lol.*

## Install with an USB stick made it done.

**But just downloading with a 349MB package, and using Rufus to make a bootUSB, Then easily completed.**
It took a lot of hours more than that I expected because I chosen to install 'GNome Packages series'.
The complete install screen came out at next morning. Actually I started this setup on last night around 10:30 PM.


## at the first trial, I gave a try without an USB.

but only Grub which is built-in boot system, but cannot figure out the WIFI connection during the installation. So I just simply failed.
That's why I tried to install with a USB stick with Rufus. 
Debian Installation without USB stick is too tricky for me.
But hopefully success with only Grub, One day.

## Why I simply attracted about a 'Geeky' trial? lol

All great :D
Nvim installation finished, and this Hugo setting too.
Hugo needed to download through its git repo.
