## When C language, Where, and by Who, for what it had been invented?

Where : America, Bell Laps
By Who : Tompson and Denis Richie
Why : For the Multics projects. To develop an operating system for a large computer that could be used by a thousand users.



## What is ISO/IEC 9899, C99 and C11?

ISO/IEC 9899's Informal name is C99.
C99 is a past version of the C Programming Language Standard.
Has significant changes compare with C89/C90.


And the next replacing version of C99 is C11.



질문2. C언어의 stdio(표준입출력)는 왜 만들어졌는가?

질문3. 전처리기(preprocessor)가 하는 일은 무엇인가? 그리고 왜 만들어졌는가?

질문4. API와 ABI는 무엇인가?

질문5. 오브젝트(object)란 무엇인가? (객체지향의 오브젝트를 말하는 것이 아님)

질문6. 링커(linker)가 하는 일은 무엇인가?

질문7. call-by-reference, call-by-value란 무엇인가? (C에 왜 call-by-reference가 없는지 설명할 수 있어야 함)

질문8. C언어의 main 함수의 return 값은 왜 int 인가? (void main()으로 선언하면 왜 틀리는가?)

## How does C programming language differ with C++? Is that a subset of C langauge?

C++ has all the features of C, but adds ***classes and other featuers to support object-oriented programming***.
* Java is based on C++ therefore inherits C features.
* c# is a more recent language derived from C++ and Java.


질문10. 하드웨어 제어에 C언어가 사용되는 이유는 무엇인가?

질문11. 시퀀스 포인트(sequence point)가 무엇인가?

질문12. Side effect란 무엇인가?

질문13. UB(Undefined behavior)란 무엇인가?


## Conclusion

C language seems the parent of all modern languages. As classes and other features came out after C language. It's very impressive as didn't know properly why C language is the most preferable language to learn in first.

Even though I've started programming through 'Java', but didn't understood these all concepts that I should had to put into my head. Yes, Just I was a coder who didn't equip those features and concepts but just copy-and-paste through Stackoverflow. That was awful level. However, those fun when I learned Java made me to be here.
I have the motivation to dig more down the knowledge of computer science hopefully.
It's the way of my preparation for future.

As far as I've found a book by K.n.King is really comprehensible for myself, I've never used the programmers words though. I can be happy today with my a small progress on this C language :)

Thank you so much Dr K.N.King.
