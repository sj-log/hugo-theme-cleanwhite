## Why I read this book

Yes, I've wanted to be a good engineer.
So found a book about mathematic.
Because I found the advices about being a great engineer needs to Mad math skill.

## Great engineers need to have a mad math skill

Well, It's not so difficult to understand why being a great engineer needs to be great at mathematic.
Math makes available at reaching on the solution. The number senses make people solve a problem in scale as well.
When we see the world in abstracting frame, the mathematic make it more physically solved.

So, before entering the 42Seoul piscine, I've thought this book would give me a great improvement, hopefully.

## It's written by a master of math.

This book is written by a Math Teacher. She is a teacher in international class in PISA.
PISA is quite famous for S.Korean or for whom may into about Educational issue.
It's very impressive and even honored to be able to read a thought from a master of Math.

### Failure is a good thing. change your frame.
She explained as following lists.

1. Failure isn't a bad. Rather, human brain literally grows up when meets the failure.
2. Brain plasticity does make a brain itself works better by struggling hard on a trial.
3. So, Failure isn't a bad, rather It should have to be encouraged for learners.


so I've put that into this way,

```
When we meet more and more failure, we're getting closed at the success.
```
Maybe this is why we all failures end up at a successor, on one day.


and continuously,

## Being failure is right Growth mindset, Failure grows the brain.

4. This mindset is called 'Growth Mindset' that make us stronger by failures.
5. When a learner rather, has a 'Fixed mindset' that make them avoid failure and afraid of it.
6. The 'Fixed mindset' makes people get stopped at challenging and look up above.


## Mathematic is all about understanding the concepts, not only about a memorization or method adjusting

7. The learners who do not like a math have the wrong concept.
8. The wrong concept is 'Math is all about just memorizing and method adjusting for exam'.
9. But Mathematic is ***a conceptual field.***
10. So, we must understand about the each chapters what they are just talking about.

11. Many 'mathematic surrenders' usually have that trait, just follows the method of chapter, and try to just use it for a quiz solving.
12. But when there is not perfectly established concept, they cannot solve a real problem.

The author quotes by a medalist of mathematic, 

        Concept makes the compression. 
        The compression is the thing that whenever you need it, 
        you can just quickly pulling it out and use it as your own skill.

13. So, Mathematic learners must understand what they learn.
14. But it's not the all side of learners' fault.
15. Sometimes the author of school book is oversimplicated on each examples.
16. So when students adjust the method, they go embrassed by that the problem seems too far apart from the school book presented.


The stories in the book about Math failures just describe me up.
I had been normally the student who stay in the front line for listening closely to the teacher,
but totally failed at grabing the concept what the teacher exaclty explain.

## The lackness of indetifying skill was my deplicit.

There are 2 reason.
first, the teacher didn't know the importance of delivering properly about the concept on each chapter.
Second, I wasn't the student who sufficiently figure out on 'Did I understand?' or 'How to check did I understand'.
I had no skill to check on both ways.
That was the vital cause that ended me up at failures in many scholarship.
Devastingly, I was a person who recognize my mind as my own.

So It was a bit suffering when I rewind up my failures.
I had to know how to identify my own 'thought' and 'inner voices'.
The lackness of identifying skill on inner thought ruined too many things in my life.
If I were properly learned that skill, my life got better for now.
However, I'd like to relieve myself, like 'I'm lucky that I still have some accomplished.'
As 'The Having' taught me.
I know we get happiness when focus on already 'possessed things'.

## Number sense?

17. Number sense does matter.
18. Most failed students do not properly establishing the number sense.

I guess the 18's cause is because of their lack of understanding on the chapter's concept.
Hm, But It seems I need to figure out what is the 'Number Sense' exactly.
