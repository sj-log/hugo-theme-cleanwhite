## Bluetooth Keyboard k380 logitech issue 

So, I got a systemic error with K380 Logitech Keyboard connection with My Debian OS.

Usually it does work well with Ubuntu, but had to look up any solution for this freezing.

The freezing always happened when I connect this verification proc on the bluetooth GUI connection proc.


## Solution 
I Found a [ solution ](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bluetooth_keyboard#Troubleshooting) on webserching.

just simply connected through the command line typing, it just solved out :)


## Conclusion.

so happy with that fact there is always a solution with Command line!
HAPPYYY!
