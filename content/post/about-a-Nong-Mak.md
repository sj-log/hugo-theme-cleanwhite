## What I'm looking for in the country side?

- I can see that I'm so much into the permacultural life style. Even we can try to live in Jin-ahn.

- When we move back to South Korea.
But Does it really good choice for our kitties?

        I do not know..

- If we can survive with our crops self-sufficiently, we can make any further step.
So, the first stage is to have the basic land and budget for it.

- Proximately, 50000$ would be desirable for living in Country side properly.

## But, How can I make that up?

No matter what, writing a book is the right decision.
It will lead more incomes. As passive income.

The house I wanna live in is

## Purifier 

5000$ for the deluted water, 1000$ 

# Conclusion

That's rather so expensive to live in Country side of South Korea. 
The minimum requirement is a house which maximizely built in 6X6 M. 
We can call it 'Nong-Mak'(A small carbin to live in Country side). And the size of 6X6 is only acceptable due to the law of building in South Korea.
So We can deal with it by 9000$ for a Nong-mak, but the problem is the cost of installation for a septic tank.
And Sepctic tank even it's illigal to build within Nong mak.
So, It's almost not profitable to have the Nong Mak as it takes too much costs of it.
