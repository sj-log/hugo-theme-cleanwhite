## Whole day reading about Warren buffett

It is super tired. Whole day just reading a book is quite tired. Well, Usually it's not. When I read a book which just directly related with my interest, It usually just kills my time. Yes, Automatically it leads me into a flow status.

but now I feel a bit tired and wanna just moving around. Maybe it's the time that I should have to having a walk or a meditation.

Yes, Let's having a walk. That would be great for myself :)


## After having a work feel great!

I have a run more prequently! This makes me boosting my studying! Feeling goooood!!
