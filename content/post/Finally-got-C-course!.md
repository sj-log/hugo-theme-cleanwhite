## Yes, I'm in Fiscine!

But had struggled in shell stage to break it out at all!
What can I do so?

This is so happy(or maybe TMI).

Ha... but that wasn't that 100% my efforts, rather took helps from other peers.
I feel so gratitude on her and other people.
So thanksful about this ;D

## If I did all my effort on this result, It would take more time.

So happy of this :D!!!!
Yes, Saehoon helped me up to take this score as well.
Yes, The piscine seems really up to how much can I cooperate with them.
and getting the useful information from them.

Of course, I should have to offer them a good resource.
I don't know what can I offer to them.
Just I do praise their ability.

some of them really good at each skillset.
It's really good to see their ability :)
