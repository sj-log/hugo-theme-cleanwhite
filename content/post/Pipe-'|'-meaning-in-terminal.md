## What is pipe? |

pipe is a operator in command.
The operator does input first command's result into second command's input.

for example, if `pwd | pbcopy` does, 
	pwd's result goes into the `pbcopy` commands arguments.
	so as pbcopy does copy into clipboard, pwd's result registered into clipboard.
	yes, pwd's result goes into pbcopy.
