One more point, There are good forests. Mai-san Provincial Park. It means the place's nature is still alive.

Since we've been into Meditation, Yoga, and greeny living(permacultural living), The place is mostly closed with that vibes what we're looking for as onf of alternative. 
**Then, The place would be adjustable for practicing Permaculture and its influence.**
