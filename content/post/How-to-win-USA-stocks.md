It's a book which published in S.Korea.
['미국주식이 답이다'](https://millie.page.link/MHkQ)

## USA stocks market has some positive features which differentiates with South Korea Stock markets.

1. It's transparency.
2. There are not many factors to determine the share price.
3. The USA share prices draw proportionally with the company's income graph.

the first feature has added the marits on investing USA market. The transparency means there are a ton of platforms we can watch and make a decision based on the visible statics. 

## There are some concepts I've learned.

- Dividend
- Business Inventory : When the sales and Inventories go up, it indicates the economic goes well, because it means a lot of consume and storing has happened at the same time. It indicates the money goes around in the market. 

## The author admits the way of Buffett is right.

Attempts on predictive approaches to the stocks by only our feelings are not that good decision. However, measuring the entreprenuers in executive position's capacity would be great option to make a decision.

So, I need to study how to determine a company's value by numbers.
