## Concepts 

- Array is a pointer.
- But It's const pointer. (how?) Array name cannot change as a const variable.
- Array name is a pointer that points to the `First element` of the Array
- Array of pointers easy to make a bunch of arrays at once.


## Tip

- Use either array subscript notation or pointer dereferencing to access array and pointer values.
- Using pointers allows more flexibility than arrays.
- Use character pointers if you want to assign string literals directly.
