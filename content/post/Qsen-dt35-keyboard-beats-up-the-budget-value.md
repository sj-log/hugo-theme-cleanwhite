Qsen DT35.

##  The price is just 10 bucks. 

It doesn't feel 'Expensive.'
However, Most of users sometimes they last this more than 10 years.

## This keyboard is very durable, strongly made and good quality.
How can I dislike this keyboard!

It's just like the old school's computer class's keyboard quality that I still in my memory.
It's kind of familiar feeling :)

## Coupang Ilsan Center 1, got recovered its delivery stock processing by only 1 day.

Last day of its delivery, Had to passing through the covid contaged delivery center of Ilsan Coupang.
So, It delayed only 1 day. But that is fine. Rather It's amazing just the Coupang Ilsan branch's delivery service took 1 day to be recovered.

of course It's a bit uncomfortable and afraid when I found this package after 1 day in front of our door.
What if there is some virus left :(
But, everything seems fine :) for now.

I'd like to keep using this keyboard :).
