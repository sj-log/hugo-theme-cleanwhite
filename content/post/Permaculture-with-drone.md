## Permaculture with drone seems perfect idea.

Recently I have been so confused about 'which type of machine have to get familiar or adjust on my permacultural purpose?'.

Bycle Machine seems too complicate on the built from scratch.
Besides, the amount of planting result isn't that higher than a drone.
A dron when it does shooting a seed to the ground, then It can plant the various type of seeds no matter what types are them.
It's like a bullet on shooting.

Then Do I need to achieve the certification drone driving?
I think so. As much as carry the seeds, the drone should have to be bigger than 12kg, then legally demanding a certification.

## My concern is how to put the algorythm into Drone.

Drone needs to plant the seeds(Shooting those seeds of tree to the ground), along the path of developer implemented.
Need to figure it out.
