Everything is great.
I just wonder how can I get better and better.

## Bullet Journaling does nicely

One of way is 'Bullet Journal'. My gf sent me about this information.
First impression, It seems like nothing. Just adding more bullet at the left side of a line on note.
But more and more using, I feel so greatly organized within this journaling.

## Feel confident to take a control my life

Mindmap, Excel sheet etc, They are used to write on Laptop.
So, All the key typing is too fast, so do not impress our brain cell root deeply. Even though that happens, I've been satisfied to journaling on laptop, but this journaling is really giving me the feeling that I can take control over mine.

## Automatically organizing system

Just linearizing writing is so easy, but it ends up with really messy look and failed on the vital goal, 'organizing'. 
However, this journaling just let writers note whatever they want it, then it automatically organize more by just putting a small bullet(symbol to identify the line is what kind of information.)

## Brain activates more with bullet journaling.

Besides, as much as this journaling rely on handwriting, It does takes the benefits of handwriting. 
When we handwrite, the brain parts organize information all together for writing next word. 
At that time, brain cells go developing itself and grows up more synapses.

## But Typing does not.

Contrarily, typing is too fast, so each brain cells do not take a part in output process. It doesn't activate our brain so much.
When we want to learn and to memorize, organizing the information in brain does matter. As much as brain cells activates mean, the synapses go growing up and connected with each other.
Lesser brain cell activation means lesser transmitter activations.

## As handwriting affects on our mood and mental strength

Those transmitters are known as 'Serotonin', 'Dopamine,'Endorphins', and 'Norepinephrine'. Those transmitters affect on our awareness, concentrations, learning, memorizations, feeling good and happy. 

## This will lead up my life easier and happier.

So writing by hands does really matter for our quality of living. When the bullet journal method adjusted into our life, our brain and life will be far more easier and happier.
