It's... [Opensource! Every body can just use it!](https://github.com/FarmBot)
That's huge... The potential isn't small. We can just adjust it as our taste or demand.
The codes are made of c++, and Rasbery pi that I've never experienced before.

screen reading process is very amazing...
Can recognize a plant whether did plant or not.

## Conclusion

I'd like to learn about how to code for drone. It needs to check the spots where we plant.
Above projects are amazing, Enoughly inspiring to me how to approach.
Youtube is the playground that just shows me how do what I want to do.
