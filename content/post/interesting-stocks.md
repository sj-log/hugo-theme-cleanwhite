### Dropped app store fee.

- They are into many developers add more values on IOS app development. [The last report says as following.](https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/_10-K-2020-(As-Filed).pdf)

> The Company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of
applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from
sales of applications through its platforms and in situations where a developer offers purchases for digital features, services, or
goods within an application. **If developers reduce their use of the Company’s platforms, including in-app purchases, then the
volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that
the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company’s financial
condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.**

- Lower the benefits and conveniences from newly created apps from the stores, the income will decrease. That's the remarkerable analysis from Apple. 

- [so maybe That's why Apple recently drops the app stores fee.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/google-apple-giving-up-less-than-5percent-of-revenue-from-apps-with-pay-changes-estimate.html)

- Maybe I should have to learn ***Swift***.
