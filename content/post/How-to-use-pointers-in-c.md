It seems very tricky.
There are too many concepts to use Pointers in C.
How?

'Pointer' means a lot.
However, commonly they act as 'Point to something'.

`*` points an address value.
So, when they meet a `&` or address value, they can dereference a value through the address.
So, `* variable` in function arguments, they requires to meet a `&`.

Because `&` returns an address from a variable.
as `*` needs an address, `&` can be a good response.
