Yeah During this Fiscine,
I feel definitely that I need to see more clearly about any quiz.

Yes, to analize the pattern what a quiz asks for is the core skill that I have to have.

Because, Most of quiz that I don't see the quiz clearly, but a bit paniced about it.
Why? 
I don't know. Rather just I can put it this way, that I don't really know about how much it was important.

Yes, The quiz is itself is a chunk of solution.
## The quiz has the solution.

A solution means of another side of a quiz which is patternized and analized.
so, when we see the quiz clearly, we can extract a solution from it.

I know this sounds tricky, but one of truth.

## But how can we grap the concept of quiz clearly?
without any panic? yes?

I think this is one another technique that I should have to figure out.
