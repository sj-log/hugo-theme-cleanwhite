Have wanted to know which language should I put all my efforts.
Lessen burdens are the way to live more succesfully.
Maintaining a lot of things make me poor and consuming my energy.
Want to prevent that worse.

## 


1. C/C++ for firmwares.

[As Robotics are very dependence on real time performance, C/C++ would be proper.](https://blog.robotiq.com/what-is-the-best-programming-language-for-robotics) have to write much more lines, though.
Many libraris for Robotics Operating systems are made up of C/C++. That's one of reason why learn them.


2. Python.




## Conclusion

- need to practice C language with more fun.
- Every articles recommend to learn C
- But reading a book about C is too boring. 
- Want to script a real practical function.
- Maybe need to write code which is really working for me.
