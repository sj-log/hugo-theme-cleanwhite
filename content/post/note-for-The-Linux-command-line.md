## Intro

[Read a book about Linux Command Shell.](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) because 42 seoul asks for performing well in Shell scripting.
And, I've felt it's quite interesting computer langauge. Shell will be used all linux distributions, so it's will be broadly used during my coding journey. So, It's worty to master it.
Below notes are the foot prints that I felt 'it's important!' or 'Wow, Interesting!'

## Note

- Why should we learn `vi`? POSIX, a standard for program compatibility on Unix systems, requires that Vi.
- `echo "string" >> <path>` just will append a line the end of the file. No need any insertion into Vim editor.
- `PS1="\a \t $ "` is able to change the prompt makes an alarm when it executes, and shows up the current time in 24h form.
- `ftp` isn't used for now. Because It sends the clear text which isn't encrypted, therefore not secure.
- `ssh -x` can make an encrypted Virtual Tunnel to make it more safer than just normal mode.
