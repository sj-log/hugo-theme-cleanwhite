He shared a lot of tips to make a knowledge to be mine.
However, The most impressive one from his tips, is '***SQ4R***' principle.


## ***SQ4R***, the way to link in between old and new knowledge.

It's a common study tip with Joe SeungYeun who mastered 7 languages(5 Latin based langauges and 2 asian langauges) and wrote a number of books already accented.

When we understand about the meaning, then we can easily make it mine.
Our brain isn't good with a 'totally new' things, but when we connect the new knowledge which wanna coming through our head, when we remind about previous knowledge what we already know about it a little, then can bridge in between the new one and old one.


1. Survey ( Find out what this book is talking about as quick )
2. Question ( Ask yourself about this topic. 'What you already know' )
3. Read ( Find the knowledge what you felt curious about )
4. Recite ( Take notes from the text but write in your own words or own method )
5. Relate ( relate with personally meaningful knowledge or already known )
6. Review 




### Survey and questioning method are used to perfectly digest a book.

Reading the chapter lists, and find out what this author wants talking about or, reading his introductions, and reading headers etc.
It's like a process to establish a skeleton. The skeleton will be the frame to stick a bunch of knowledge.




### Makes me reminding the France parents who likes to answer by 'Questioning'

It seems like a question is the key. When we feel curiosity or questions, It's a timing that our brain starts learning in real. That was the reason why the france parents always 'asked' about anything to their child. That questions headed to pop out the question from the head. That purposeful attitude encourage learning. Then, The child becomes a better individual by the learning.



## Human being is better on concept and story.

This is why the modern product selling technique always answers 'connect with storytelling on your product'. I can see the human being loves the story, but not sure 'WHY' human being loves the story and meaning?
Because we're used with the meaning? History? As we has our own story, maybe it becomes the method to understand other history.
probably, That's why the Joe SeungYeun already cited that `read the background stories about a topic`. It seems he indirectly meant about this feature by that fact 'human being is better with story, so understand the people who related this topics. It seems take too long, but It's worhty.'



## Determine a right place to study. 

Your subconscious and focus will be determined. 

A place has its primary purpose. Such as a bed room is for sleep and a dinner table is for eat. 
As Mr. Lobdell's method accents, our subconscious is so powerful.
If we choose a wrong place, our study will not go into the study.
We should choose right place for a study.
So, He encouraged to buy a light ramp.


## Key is 'Curiosity Raising'

I should have to assure that I possess the questions before reading a script. Questions lead better understanding and connect the synapses in our brain.
Establishing questions before reading does really matter.

When we quickly look the head titles in a book, then the brain prepares the absolb the knowledge which will input by scketching what this book wanna speak about. 


## The 'Net studying method' has a common with this

When we have already a rich background knowledge about the topic, we go further understanding and grasp the new knowledge more easily. 

This is why the great lecturers always present a question at the start. That was for stimulation. The stimulation helps the audience starts absorb the presented knowledge. If the audiences have already a thick ground previous knowledge aobut it, He would reach at better understanding.

In that moment, Joe SeungYeun's method lights up. ***'Study a topic as establishing a net'.*** The primary topic that we want to understand, when we understand them with other secondary knowledge will support to understand that main topic.
As when we understood how Steve Jobs ended up with the Beautiful UI of iPhone by understanding his interest on Keligraphy.

## RAM does matter as well

Sleep within RAM does matter as well as our brain puzzling at that time. When we lost that RAM sleep, our studying goes meaningless. The information pieces goes puzzled up at that time. So 'Sleep tight' does the hack as well.



# Conclusion

1. This is amazing tutorial how to study better.
2. Studying place does matter.
3. Joe SeungYeun catches rightly.
4. Background knowledge does matter.
5. Our brain does connect better with meaning and stories.
6. Learning has happend with 80% writing and 20% reading. 
7. Break does matter. Work with a block scheduling(Pomodo). Our brain does rightly with breaktime.


Just reconfirm what does really matter in studying. It's about linking in between the knowledge that I already know and new.
The keypoint was about ***SQ4R***, which is a kind of knowledge funnel establishing.

And I should have to install **a pomodo everywhere.** I don't want to drain my energy without any achievements. Break does matter.
