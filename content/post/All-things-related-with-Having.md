It seems the all the things related with the Having.
Even though I'm enoughly fulfilled with good enviroment, without the Having, I'd be in blind.

Yes, That's critical obstacle for living in better way.
More than any other skills and methods, I should have to practice the 'Having'.

Remind about the things that I already possess. Remind about the things that already fulfill my lackness and deplicit. I must understand how much having can just determine my life and quality of living.

How can I never forget the Having?
Having. That Having I must surround myself.
I should have to surround myself with the people who already know and who willing to practice the positiveness :).
