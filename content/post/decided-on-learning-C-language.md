## So I'll get start to learn C language.
Even I didn't start or make any installation with that in this Linux laptop, but I believe there would be many profit for myself.

## C language can be used in broad fields.

As it's called as a middle ware language, that can cover even in Embeded environment.

As I'm into permaculture, one day I'll try to make the better enviroment construct by the installation of sensors in a place to optimize the growth of crops.

When It comes, the C language would be brighting out to the role.



## C language should need many hands to use it properly.

As It can handle the memory usage, or the broken down system details, I'll need to understand further about hardware system which runs the codes.

Then, It might make me more understand about computer environment and any other higher languages, Python and Golang etc.

## If I can solve in broad field, It means that I can solve much more problems by my hands.

It means that I can be more closer at the rich-ability.

Being rich means, I have the ability to solve many problems.

Actually a profit comes from solving a problem of People.
If I can make better version of myself who can solve wherever I go, Why not being capable for it?


## Conclusion.

Learning C would be a bit rough anddifficult as jumping over the huddles, but I belive it would bring myself to be a better programmer and logical thinker :)
