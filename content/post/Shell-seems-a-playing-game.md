Well, Still there are some things that I should have to keep learning.
C Language, and shell are the things.

I didn't start yet about C lang, but The shell.

## Shell scripts seem very useful more than any other language.

Javascript, Java, etc. They need for only specific environment. On Web, or on a program.
But the shell, When you have any of O/S, as there is basically installed shell. 
You can get profits from the built-in shell programs.

`cronetab` helps me to use this computer as Auto-Macro. It can notice me by setting a time.
Automatically help myself by this programs, since I've started using this laptop on Linux Env.

## Last night, Learning about shell, It was like a playing game lol.

Egoing's Daily coding shell course is so fun!
There are amount of 'fun', useful and 'practical' subjects.
I can directly adjust those shell programs that I even didn't noticed that exist into my profit.
Shell is the thing that helps my living quality by saving the time.
