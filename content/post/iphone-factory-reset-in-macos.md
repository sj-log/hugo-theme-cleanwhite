## Summary
- Factory reset should be done by button pressing.
- Check it out the way to `safe mode` by [here](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201263).

I've struggled to factory-reset with an Iphone.

It does take 2 days make it done. 

## Tried first in MacOS

Firstly, I've given a try with MacBook. However, Finding iTunes from the Mac wasn't easy.
Even Download & Installed by the Apple Support page's iTunes file for MacOS just has shown up `Incompatible version`.

It has driven me crazy.

## gave a try by Wine on Debian laptop

Secondly, tried through My Lenovo laptop which is installed with Debian.
Yes, Linux kernel. It's not supposed to manage any MacOS Applications.

However, as I've found the way to install it through `Wine 32bit`, finally succeeded after a few struggles.
Otherwise, It went failed to make it reset-factory.
I gave the trial through this [Linux Q&N answer](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1155189/itunes-in-wine-black-screen-on-ubuntu-18-04). But It shown up broken itunes.
in First trial of installation Itunes in Debian, ended up that showing a black-screen, in Second trial of it ended up broken function with iTunes with clear screen.

So just felt like 'I'm done' but, kept finding any solution on googling, then found [that answer.](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201263)

## Factory reset through restore mode.

It doesn't need any other software, but can adjust in the situation when you forget the passcord, and ended up 'Activation Blocked' screen.


## Conclusion.

I become a bit hate on Apple product.
There are abstractly too many way to make it done, but only 1 way to `real way`.
Probably, I'll need minimize the approaching way at real solution which is straight forward.
How can I find a solution which is more straight foward and clear in any case?
