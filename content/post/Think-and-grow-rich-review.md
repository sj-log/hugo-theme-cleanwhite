### How to be rich even in spirituality.

He does really great job and, no matter what it is, his book just shows me how to be the rich man in genuine term. 
Just having a lot of money in material isn't a meaning of right form of Rich.
The Rich that I think is, Materially, and spiritually being free. Of course, Being free almost can be achieved by materially Free, by a lot earning of money. That's so true.
However, no matter how much do I possess the materialises, If I know how to be rich in spirituality, I can get the better life living. :)

#### This book helps me how to deal with negative mind.
That's why I am so glad to find this book.
I've just wanted to fulfill my dried soul from this never satisfiable living. Desire is like a pot which isn't able to measure its depth. I didn't understand why I had to suffer with the negative thoughts. It's just tangled by the deep dark mindset. Even though I dreamed to be living in positive emotions, didn't know how to deal with those poisonous emotions.


### truly worthy, I hat off to the Hill.
I should have to keep transcribing those quotes that shakes my emotions, into my note.
Whenever I find those quotes rooting down my heart, I feel to be cured.
I can understand why a person in introduction, claimed this book should be read in all over the American students in public school as a mandatory.
It's truly worthy reading.


### I dream big as a rich man.
Wanna build the place to make people happy.
Although there wouldn't be a physical place, I'd like to make a platform where can people just simply visit-able, and find out what their souls get favors.
