                <p>Yes, Since I&rsquo;ve came across here from Bali.
franckly, I found myself, lack of grit.
Well, My Mindset always chased into achieveing my longterm goal.
However, I spent many days with wetting my pillows because of unresistable laziness, somehow.</p>
<p>That was true suffering.
So I wrote down my feeling tried to figure out why my laziness I cannot beat it up.</p>
<p>then I found a book.
The book said, my status was lack of willpower.
yes. WILLPOWER.</p>
<h2 id="the-reason-of-simplicities-by-ceos">The reason of simplicities by CEOs</h2>
<p>The reason why Steve jobs sturbonely had wore the black polar t-shirt with blue jean and a pair of snikers.
We can see the number of CEO or great decision makers always stick with a simplicity in their lifestyle.</p>
<p>Well, I cannot tell myself was a totally unknown about &lsquo;Simplicity&rsquo;, but I changed after living with my partner.
She has been arguing to live a bit fency way within a bit of simplicity. But yeah no matter what, the cause of my laziness was so clear. I didn&rsquo;t fully understood about why simplicity does matter.</p>
<p>Just I thought that necessary reason of simplicity is to be lesser fatigue and clustering.
Cleaning a house was really difficult and a ton of tasks were required.
That was the one of reason why I leave the Bali.
and I argued with her a lot of times.</p>
<p>We had to understand why the simplicity does matter for willpower.
But yes, It&rsquo;s fair enough as I didn&rsquo;t know what is the relevant point between willpower and simplicity.</p>
<p>Simplicity decreases the decisions in a day. If we simply wear similar clothes every day, or eat same menu for nutritions, our willpower will remain highly.
yes, remaining high willpower does matter. When we need a big decision, we need a big willpower as well.
so we should have to keep our willpower and energy as a budget.
When we lost our willpower, it means we cannot get closer at our goal.
because we will never decide the taskes to the longterm goal we hold.</p>
<p>and this book is talking about how to remain the willpower.
above simplicity is the part of tips for high willpower.
2-3 tips are highly impressive.</p>

</p>
<p>The book said, my status was lack of willpower.</p>
<h2 id="self-compassion">Self Compassion</h2>
<p>Yes, My reason that wet my pillows, was caused by self-criticism.
I was too cold for myself. When I don&rsquo;t get enough tasks done as supposed, then I blamed myself.
Yes. I guess the negative stance for myself is a kind of legacy my young age.
I raised under the parents who weren&rsquo;t properly beloved. Yes my parents were not enoughly cared.
My father had to sell some boiled potatoes and corns in a train when his friends afforded to attend an elementary school.
My mother had been raised by a grand mother who had mentally sicked. Her grandmother always suspect grandfather does cheating her.
Many times my mother got hit and slapped when she look at her mother&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Yes truly poor family histories. So my childhood was not that happy as well as my parents didn&rsquo;t know how to take care properly.
My father had been too strict and even cruel. When I couldn&rsquo;t make a right answer for a quiz in mathematic practice, he slaped my face.
I still traumatically remember those sadest and emotional lonely memories.
And on a day, he just locked a room left me with a quiz book. &lsquo;Never think about getting out of this book unless you finish all quizes in the book&rsquo;. then he slammed the door room.
as much as he had been brutal on me, It was easy to find his yelling and inserting by cursed words to my mother and me.
Above memories make myself feels so sick about any kind of violences.
Yes, I hate people who easily say inserting and demoralized words.
Even though that is so light, I don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>As time goes by, I became the person who allegdly feel disgust any type of violences, but couldn&rsquo;t take off <em>self-criticism.</em></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realized that I still had a negative trait influenced by my father.
I still strictly blamed myself when I couldn&rsquo;t make a thing to be done perfectfully.
According to this book, self-criticism makes ourselves freezing in front of any challenges.
Since we do blame ourselves from a failure, our subconsciousness just hesitate to try the next task, because of the fear if he cannot reach at the requirements.</p>
<p>The hesitation was the main cause myself crying out.
However, my action wasn&rsquo;t that much changed even though felt a lot sadness and frustrations in deep.</p>
<p>But this book presented the medication for that depression. Self-compassion.
Self-compassion is a being good friend for myself.
It&rsquo;s exactly opposite of self-criticism. We do not blame ourselves, but understand why resulted like that.
&ldquo;yes it&rsquo;s alright, you still got some part of yield from it. It was zero. It was an experience that you learned something didn&rsquo;t work. It was productive trial.
besides, You figured out why It didn&rsquo;t work. A realization as you got, It&rsquo;s benefitial. So don&rsquo;t be sad. At the next time, You will do better.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em><strong>Yes, praising myself.</strong></em>
Patting my heart as a nice friend would do.
So, compassionating myself is the best way to take off the depressions and procrastinating habits.</p>
<p>I guess this will be one of useful leadership. As I&rsquo;m facing of the bootcamp, this will useful.
I must be compassionate for others. The students who are same situation like me. They do want to be a successful developer as me.
They want to live professionally.
<em><strong>Then I should have to be professionally compassionate for myself and them.</strong></em></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t figure out what is exactly the best behavior as the term of &lsquo;Self-Compassion&rsquo;. Maybe I need to read a relevant book for deeper understanding on self-compassion.</p>
<h2 id="analyzing-my-procrastinating-habits">Analyzing my procrastinating habits.</h2>
<p>Yes, like a doctor analize a sickness, we have to ask ourselves why I avoided a necessary task by writing.
So the author of this book suggested to fill up below table.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Avoided task</th>
<th>Explanation</th>
<th>plan</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>planing tomorrow taskes before going to bed</td>
<td>At night, it&rsquo;s really not easy to resist a few entertaining activities. Listening a favorite radio, or youtube clips and checking the messages from SNS. So cannot take a plan when before going to bed.</td>
<td>Giving up to check all SNS. Need to negotiate. I should have to know that I can enjoy every things that I want unless giving up my longterm goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Don&rsquo;t sleep until 1AM</td>
<td>talking with the friends in SNS take too many hours and too addictive. It&rsquo;s really hard to turn off when it should be.</td>
<td>SNS is evil. I must understand about this. I need to compare between the result of longterm goal and this short term sns entertaining.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>When we can check the behind of an invisible trait, we can fix it up.
The author said, <strong>It&rsquo;s the power of awareness.</strong></p>
<h2 id="say-when-on-a-task-will-be-done">Say &lsquo;WHEN&rsquo; on a task will be done.</h2>
<p>To do list - Calendar Transferring the author recommended.
As we humanbeings are so obsessively managable by setting when we will do a specific task.
He explained by an experiment with 2 groups of addicts.
2 groups both had to write resumes.
One group is required to plan &lsquo;When&rsquo; they will write resumes, and another group isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It turned out previous group 100% addicts complete resumes, but the another 100% didn&rsquo;t.
The result shown the message clearly.
We are so clearly following up when a plan is so detail with When.</p>
<p>In my days, yes I wasn&rsquo;t a person who make sure when will do a task.
Using a calendar recommended in this chapter.</p>

</p>
<p>listing down all todolist before sleep and transferring them onto a calendar will be perfect combo.</p>
<h2 id="understand-about-importance-of-willpower">Understand about importance of Willpower</h2>
<p>Willpower itself is an energy to suppress unnecessary behavior to achieve my goals.
For example, If one wants gain more muscles, he must raise more barbeles than scolling down instagram feeds.
When we choose the exercise, rather than SNS feeding, the energy to decide the right task is Willpower.</p>
<p>We need this willpower.</p>
<p>When we don&rsquo;t left enough willpower, we just choose wrongly.
So we must care our willpower still remain.</p>
<h2 id="boosting-up-willpower">Boosting up Willpower</h2>
<p>Simplicity, Nutritions, sleep well, Workout and Meditation.</p>
<p>above examples are the effective way to keep our willpower high.</p>
<h3 id="meditation">Meditation</h3>
<p>Meditation personally I&rsquo;ve experienced it&rsquo;s power.
When I focus on what I&rsquo;m doing right now, the rest of works in a day spontaneously able to be done.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Even 5 mins break while pomodoro end of each block, doing a meditation is really refresh my concentration level.
You can feel it. Just give it a try. Breath in and out for 5 mins with closing eyes. That mediation will refresh your pre-frontal cortext in brain. The area in brain manages willpower. Focus, Judgement, Patient, Emotional control and attention.</p>
<h3 id="nutritions">Nutritions.</h3>
<p>Plant-based diet will be good for remain high willpower.
Meat does hurt intestines during digestion.
So It delays body recovery.
But plant&rsquo;s phytochemical active positively.
I better stick with plant based food.
I&rsquo;ll bring a homemade lunch box.</p>
<p>but If it&rsquo;s better to just use a restaurant to outsource my jobs to prepare a lunch, I&rsquo;ll change this decision.</p>
<h3 id="work-out">Work out</h3>
<p>as meditation does on brain, Work out just develop and refresh a brain.</p>
<p>When our body moves, the bloodstream ahead to the brain.
The fatigue and willpower will be refilled at the moment.</p>
<p>But I wonder the difference between cardiovascular work out and weight training on the effect.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion.</h2>
<p>I had too many clusters in my life.
Self-criticism, Didn&rsquo;t recoginized about willpower properly.
This is why we need read what we need to know.
A book always gives me a solution. The solutions give me to be able to achieve my goal. Being a better one.</p>
<p>But the subject is not discovered if I let my hands without writing.
Yes writing discover what I have to learn.
During a writing, I can see that what I want to know, What is my concern and problems.</p>
<p>To solve problems, surely it makes me looking for some books platform. Kindle, Pdfdrives, Mille&rsquo;s shelf and Goodread.</p>
<p>Those are amazing resources.
I am so happy that realize not too late.
If I aware this needs of reading book late, my life would be miserable.</p>
<p>I am appreciating to know the needs of learning.
Learning is always happened on a curiosity or a problem.
Finding a problem is the shortcut of solution.
But we do hesitate and wary by unveiled problem in our daily life.
By writing, we can see which problem makes ourselves suffer.
Our pain, sufferings are the problem.
When we can define and shape out a problem, we can solve the math.</p>
