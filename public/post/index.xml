      <description>This themes&amp;rsquo;s simplicity of beauty just haunting me so badly. Yes, This is my first blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen love at the Eureka Themes..
Appreciate deeply on C. Wang who built this theme.
Had other social platforms, but need to gather them all in one. Well, Yeah I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the Brunch(A Book-write-encouraging Platform). However, thought, it&amp;rsquo;d be better if funnel all traffics into a place where gathered all contents.

      <description>i += j += k;
This assignment seems tricky. but Knking&amp;rsquo;s book say, there is a tip.
i += (j += k);
so, j+=k becomes (j=j+k), hence operated first. at here, K never has any operating without only its initialization. if k = 3; k becomes just 3.
j becomes j+3.
and,
i = i+ (j+3).
That&amp;rsquo;s it!</description>

      <description>Yes, Since I&amp;rsquo;ve came across here from Bali. franckly, I found myself, lack of grit. Well, My Mindset always chased into achieveing my longterm goal. However, I spent many days with wetting my pillows because of unresistable laziness, somehow.
That was true suffering. So I wrote down my feeling tried to figure out why my laziness I cannot beat it up.
then I found a book. The book said, my status was lack of willpower.</description>

      <description>Concepts  Array is a pointer. But It&amp;rsquo;s const pointer. (how?) Array name cannot change as a const variable. Array name is a pointer that points to the First element of the Array Array of pointers easy to make a bunch of arrays at once.  Tip  Use either array subscript notation or pointer dereferencing to access array and pointer values. Using pointers allows more flexibility than arrays. Use character pointers if you want to assign string literals directly.</description>

      <description>Well, Still there are some things that I should have to keep learning. C Language, and shell are the things.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t start yet about C lang, but The shell.
Shell scripts seem very useful more than any other language. Javascript, Java, etc. They need for only specific environment. On Web, or on a program. But the shell, When you have any of O/S, as there is basically installed shell. You can get profits from the built-in shell programs.</description>

Even though I&amp;rsquo;m not that much prepared with French.
They mainly focus on teaching code with C. C is the mostly interesting language for me, by its usage in various machine.

      <description>The problem So, the problem was that I had to keep writing down my credential info for pushing onto git repo.
Solution   git config credential.helper store
  git push &amp;lt;repo&amp;gt;
  git config --global credential.helper &amp;quot;cache --timeout 7200&amp;quot; This setting will expire your cached credential info for 2 hours later.
  Conclusion  git config credential.helper store commands order to store the git user info (pw, id) in local env - It can raise security issue.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ll get start to learn C language. Even I didn&amp;rsquo;t start or make any installation with that in this Linux laptop, but I believe there would be many profit for myself.
C language can be used in broad fields. As it&amp;rsquo;s called as a middle ware language, that can cover even in Embeded environment.
As I&amp;rsquo;m into permaculture, one day I&amp;rsquo;ll try to make the better enviroment construct by the installation of sensors in a place to optimize the growth of crops.</description>

Just having a lot of money in material isn&amp;rsquo;t a meaning of right form of Rich. The Rich that I think is, Materially, and spiritually being free. Of course, Being free almost can be achieved by materially Free, by a lot earning of money.</description>

      <description>Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m in Fiscine! But had struggled in shell stage to break it out at all! What can I do so?
This is so happy(or maybe TMI).
Ha&amp;hellip; but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t that 100% my efforts, rather took helps from other peers. I feel so gratitude on her and other people. So thanksful about this ;D
If I did all my effort on this result, It would take more time. So happy of this :D!</description>

      <description>It seems very tricky. There are too many concepts to use Pointers in C. How?
&amp;lsquo;Pointer&amp;rsquo; means a lot. However, commonly they act as &amp;lsquo;Point to something&amp;rsquo;.
* points an address value. So, when they meet a &amp;amp; or address value, they can dereference a value through the address. So, * variable in function arguments, they requires to meet a &amp;amp;.
Because &amp;amp; returns an address from a variable. as * needs an address, &amp;amp; can be a good response.</description>

      <description>why to use void function in C langauge? Don&amp;rsquo;t need to know what the caller to do with return 0.
normally the caller from outside of scope, can use the return value 0. However, if unusing any return, it less our pay attentions of it. Yes it saves time, processing and thought! Less is more.

      <description>str[] does variable, as str[] defines an array. but *str does store an address, which is a string in random memory. So it&amp;rsquo;s a random memory, not easy to approach and manipulate the string.
but I wonder why? how str[] defines an array. and as we know, an array we can manipulate each data from the each cells.</description>

      <description>Yeah During this Fiscine, I feel definitely that I need to see more clearly about any quiz.
Yes, to analize the pattern what a quiz asks for is the core skill that I have to have.
Because, Most of quiz that I don&amp;rsquo;t see the quiz clearly, but a bit paniced about it. Why? I don&amp;rsquo;t know. Rather just I can put it this way, that I don&amp;rsquo;t really know about how much it was important.</description>
