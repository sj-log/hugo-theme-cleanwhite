      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ll get start to learn C language. Even I didn&amp;rsquo;t start or make any installation with that in this Linux laptop, but I believe there would be many profit for myself.
C language can be used in broad fields. As it&amp;rsquo;s called as a middle ware language, that can cover even in Embeded environment.
As I&amp;rsquo;m into permaculture, one day I&amp;rsquo;ll try to make the better enviroment construct by the installation of sensors in a place to optimize the growth of crops.</description>

      <description>How to be rich even in spirituality. He does really great job and, no matter what it is, his book just shows me how to be the rich man in genuine term. Just having a lot of money in material isn&amp;rsquo;t a meaning of right form of Rich. The Rich that I think is, Materially, and spiritually being free. Of course, Being free almost can be achieved by materially Free, by a lot earning of money.</description>
