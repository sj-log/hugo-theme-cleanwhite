      <description>Struggled with pushing Vim-fugitive. The main issue was happening whenever I tried to push on Vim-fugitive.
Problem  load Username failed  fatal: could not read Username for &#39;https://github.com&#39;: No such device or address ssh-askpass error  ssh_askpass: exec(/usr/bin/ssh-askpass): No such file or directory debian Cause The message meant that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t verified with my own SSH.
Solution  had to install ssh-add, through sudo apt-get install ssh-add. firstly made sure whether do I have the keygen existed by ls -al ~/.</description>
