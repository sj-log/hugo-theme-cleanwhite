      <description>Concepts  Array is a pointer. But It&amp;rsquo;s const pointer. (how?) Array name cannot change as a const variable. Array name is a pointer that points to the First element of the Array Array of pointers easy to make a bunch of arrays at once.  Tip  Use either array subscript notation or pointer dereferencing to access array and pointer values. Using pointers allows more flexibility than arrays. Use character pointers if you want to assign string literals directly.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ll get start to learn C language. Even I didn&amp;rsquo;t start or make any installation with that in this Linux laptop, but I believe there would be many profit for myself.
C language can be used in broad fields. As it&amp;rsquo;s called as a middle ware language, that can cover even in Embeded environment.
As I&amp;rsquo;m into permaculture, one day I&amp;rsquo;ll try to make the better enviroment construct by the installation of sensors in a place to optimize the growth of crops.</description>
