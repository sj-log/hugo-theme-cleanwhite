      <description>Yes, Since I&amp;rsquo;ve came across here from Bali. franckly, I found myself, lack of grit. Well, My Mindset always chased into achieveing my longterm goal. However, I spent many days with wetting my pillows because of unresistable laziness, somehow.
That was true suffering. So I wrote down my feeling tried to figure out why my laziness I cannot beat it up.
then I found a book. The book said, my status was lack of willpower.</description>
