      <description>How to be rich even in spirituality. He does really great job and, no matter what it is, his book just shows me how to be the rich man in genuine term. Just having a lot of money in material isn&amp;rsquo;t a meaning of right form of Rich. The Rich that I think is, Materially, and spiritually being free. Of course, Being free almost can be achieved by materially Free, by a lot earning of money.</description>
